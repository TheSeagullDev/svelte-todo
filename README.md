# Yet another todo list app

Whoa... Another todo app you say? How original.

So. Why did I make a todo app when I already [made one](https://github.com/TheSeagullDev/odin-todo) a few months ago?

## A bunch of reasons

### Reason the first: My old one sucked

Yeah... it wasn't great... It was one of my first "big" projects and I got so caught up in trying to make the most optimal data storage and organizational best practices that I spent waaay too much time on the logic and waaay too little time on the UI and actual experience of using the app. This time, I focused on making something a lot simpler, more straightforward, with a much cleaner (and in my opinion way better looking) UI.

### Reason the second: I'm trying to learn things!

I finally took the plunge, I've chosen my JS framework. I've moved on from vanilla JS and `document.querySelector()` in favor of what everyone claims is so much better.

Svelte.

Yes, using $state and :bind are really cool and feel like magic. I've also never done anything serverside before (I still haven't) but I had to learn to deal with some of that anyway to set up localStorage (I'm honestly not sure why every guide online uses stores, you totally don't need them)

### Reason the third: Learning more things!

I'm fed up with vanilla CSS. It sucks. I'm sorry, had to be said. That being said, Tailwind has been on my radar for a _long_ time and I finally got an excuse to use it in a real project. It makes a lot of things soooooo much easier (although CSS in general still sucks but that might just be a skill issue). 
tldr; css bad, tailwind make it slightly less bad

## OK, so what's so special about this todo list app anyway?

Well it's nothing groundbreaking, but I think it's nice. It uses localStorage, so your info is saved on your computer. It uses all of svelte's awesome reactivity to make really snappy animations and make all the logic work with _so much less code_. It uses some nice tailwind magic to make it responsive on mobile, my first app I've actually designed with that in mind (mostly because I got fed up with trying to show someone else what I made but only having a phone and being forced to see how atrocious it would look on mobile).

But yeah, that's it. I might come back to this later once I learn more backend stuff and add accounts and some other stuff in the future, but for now, I'm done with this.
